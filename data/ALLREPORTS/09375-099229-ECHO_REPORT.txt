INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial MR. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. 

Conclusions: 
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. 
2. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
3. No clear evidence of endocarditis seen.
