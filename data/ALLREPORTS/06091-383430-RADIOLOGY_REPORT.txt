FINAL REPORT
PELVIC ULTRASOUND

INDICATION FOR STUDY:  Postpartum bleeding.

The study is performed as a followup from the recent study of [**2014-07-01**].  The patient has subsequently had curettage and pelvic embolization. Transabdominal and endovaginal ultrasound were performed and showed the uterus to be anteverted and within normal limits for a recently postpartum uterus. The endometrial cavity echoes show a maximum thickness of approximately 7 mm. The area of increased vascularity in the left anterior fundus is again visualized with a feeding vessel to a small focus of material within the endometrial cavity which measures less than 5 mm maximum dimension.

The ovaries are within normal limits for size with no evidence of adnexal mass nor any evidence of free pelvic fluid.

IMPRESSION:

Significant improvement in the appearance of the uterus since the prior examination.  The area of vascularity is again seen in the left anterior fundus myometrium.  There is likely a small retained product of conception less than 5 mm in size.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3374**].
