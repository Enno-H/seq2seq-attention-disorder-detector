He was in no acute distress.  He had decreased breath sounds at the bases.  He was also slightly tachypneic with no crepitus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit and transferred to the ICU for close monitoring given his pneumomediastinum, most likely secondary to perforation during his endoscopic procedure.  At that point, it was unclear if he perforation was contained.  He underwent a CAT scan with oral and IV contract, which revealed that there was no extravasation of contrast from the esophagus into the mediastinum.

The patient was made NPO with NG tube suction, given IV fluids and IV Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Flagyl.  The patient was closely monitored in the ICU setting.

On [**Hospital Unit Name 189**] day #3, the patient's condition was felt to be stable and he was transferred to the floor.  At this point, he was kept NPO with the NG tube to suction.  A thoracic consultation by Dr. .................... was obtained.  It was his opinion that the patient undergo a barium swallow to again re-evaluate his esophageal perforation.  Therefore, on hospital day #5, the patient underwent a barium swallow, which revealed no extravasation of barium from the esophagus. At this point, the patient's NG tube was discontinued, although he was kept NPO overnight.  TPN was continued and, therefore, on the next morning, hospital day #6, he was advanced to clears.  The patient tolerated the clears and on hospital day #7, the patient was advanced to regular diet.
He was tolerating a regular diet, therefore, the TPN and central line were discontinued.  The antibiotics were changed from IV Ampicillin, Gentamycin, and Flagyl to p.o. Augmentin. Of note:  The patient's hypertensive medication was increased from Lopressor 50 q.d. to 50 b.i.d.  Of note: Given the patient's advanced multiple sclerosis, he has a chronic suprapubic catheter in place.  The Urology Service was consulted and on [**2010-05-28**] the patient's catheter was changed given that he was admitted when he was due to see his urologist in [**Location (un) **] to have it changed.  The patient was discharged home on [**2010-05-28**].  His personal care attendant was notified and will be seeing him at home to help him with activities of daily living.
