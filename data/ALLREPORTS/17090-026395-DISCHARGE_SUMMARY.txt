Abdominal exam was unremarkable. The right hip dressing is saturated with blood with drains to suction canisters full of blood. The right thigh is tense and with tenderness out of proportion to the exam. Sensory motor intact bilateral lower extremities.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient had 2 Hemovacs placed. The patient was transferred to the PACU, extubated and hemodynamically stable with pain well controlled.

Admitting labs: White count was 9.0, hematocrit 29.3, platelets 103K. BUN 14, creatinine 1.0.

Postoperative white count was 10.1, hematocrit 32.1. BUN and creatinine remained stable. The patient had 2+ DP and PT pulses with a warm right lower extremity. Sensory and motor were intact.

The patient remained in the PACU and then was transferred to the VICU for continued hemodynamic monitoring. Postoperative day 1 there were no overnight events. The patient was hemodynamically stable. T-max was 101.1 to 100.2. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Incisions were clean, dry and intact. There is minimal erythema with a small amount of oozing at the superior aspect of the incision. This was likely secondary to skin bleeding. The right foot pulses remained palpable.
