[**05-12**] CXR: Left basilar opacity is likely effusion and atelectasis, though an infectious consolidation cannot be excluded.  Two right-sided chest tubes with no evidence of pneumothorax.  NG tube tip lies within the stomach, though the tube could be advanced to ensure that the side hole is within the stomach.  Mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema are consistent with recent tracheobronchoplasty and chest tube insertion.

[**05-13**] CXR: Status post removal of right apical chest tube, with no residual right pneumothorax. Right basilar chest tube is still in place. Also, status post removal of the nasogastric tube. Otherwise, unchanged appearance since yesterday

[**05-14**] CXR: There is no pneumothorax after removal of the right chest tube, given the limitation of patient motion. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, possibly loculated. The aorta remains dilated and tortuous. No new consolidations.

[**05-15**] CXR: Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged, with apparent loculation of the right effusion laterally. No pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname 5275**] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2014-05-12**] after undergoing a tracheobronchoplast for his tracheobronchomalacia.  Please refer to the operative note for details of this procedure.  
Postoperatively, he was cared for in the CSRU.

On postoperative day one, his pain was controlled with an epidural.  His chest tube was removed.  His [**Male First Name (un) **] drain remained until POD2.  He was noted to be in atrial fibrillation, and was begun on an amiodarone and a diltiazem drip.  The Diltiazem was stopped.  His rhythm had converted to sinus.

On POD3, he was transferred to the [**Wardname 5276**] floor unit.  His amiodarone was converted to an oral dose of 400 mg twice a day, to continue for a total of 7 days, and then taper to a dose of 200 mg daily.  On POD4, he was seen by Physical Therapy, who felt he may be able to go home with services, however, his wife is currently disabled, and his family felt strongly about his being placed in a rehabilitation facilty for a short time.

He continued to do well, and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on POD6.
