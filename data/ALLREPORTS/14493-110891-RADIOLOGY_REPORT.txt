AP UPRIGHT CHEST:  Endotracheal tube identified, approximately 6 cm above the carina.  There is a right-sided central line, with its tip in the distal SVC. NG tube identified, with its tip off the inferior margin of the film.  Again identified is a large left hilar mass, somewhat impinging on the left main bronchus, corresponding to the patient's known lung cancer.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Interval resolution of left-sided pleural effusion; however, there remains a small pocket of loculated effusion seen on the lateral wall.  Interval improvement in right-sided pulmonary edema.  No new infiltrates identified.  Visualized osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1) Interval improvement in predominantly right-sided pulmonary edema. 2) Interval resolution of left-sided pleural effusion. 3) Stable appearance of left-sided hilar mass.
