The patient was in his usual state of good health until approximately one week prior to transfer when he had an episode of vomiting and believes he may have aspirated. He developed a right sided chest pain, sharp and pleuritic in nature.  He subsequently developed shortness of breath and presented to the hospital where he works. He was noted to have concerning lesion on chest X-ray and he was admitted and placed on 100% oxygen. He was given broad spectrum antibiotics with gatifloxacin and clindamycin. Linezolid was eventually added. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 79**] per the family's request.

On arrival, the patient continues to report shortness of breath and pleuritic right-sided chest pain. He states that when he takes the oxygen off, he can only speak two sentences before becomming short of breath. He denies fevers, chills and night sweats.

Pertinent Results:
Labs at OSH ([**2016-03-20**]): 
WBC 12.0 (88% N, 8% L, 3.5% M), Hct 35.7, Plt 454
Na 136, K 3.8, Cl 95, CO2 29, BUN 4, Cr 0.9
ALT 13, AST 42, Alk phos 84, TB 0.4, Alb 2.2, TP 6.1

ABG: 7.44/50/74

CXR (OSH): right upper lobe cavitary infiltrate

Chest CT (OSH): diffuse prominent right upper lobe infiltrate with 5cm cavitary mass, 2cm right upper lobe cavitary mass, small right pleural effusion, some right hilar lymphadenopathy

[**Hospital1 79**] LABS/STUDIES:

CT CHEST ([**2016-03-23**]) - IMPRESSION: 1) 3.5-cm cavitary lesion with air-fluid level and thickened wall in the right middle lobe as described above, probably representing lung abscess, mentioned in the requisition. However, please also consider the possibility of septic emboli. 2) Multiple patchy opacities in bilateral lungs, more on the right, which may represent multifocal pneumonia versus atypical edema. 3) Bilateral diffuse opacity, representing pulmonary edema due to ARDS. 4) Bilateral pleural effusion, greater on the right, associated with bibasilar atelectasis. 5) Perivascular lymphadenopathy. 

ECHO/TTE ([**2016-03-22**]): The LA is mildly dilated. LV wall thicknesses are normal. The LV cavity is moderately dilated. Overall LV systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the LV. There is no VSD. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The AV leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the AV. The MV appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no MVP. No mass or vegetation is seen on the MV. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. The absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically suggested.  

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respirtory Distress/PNA: The patient presented to an OSH with fever, bandemia, and respiratory discomcomfort. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 79**] with ARDS-like findings (ARDS, PNA or lung injury via mechanical ventilation) and a RUL cavitary lesion (Infarction vs Abscess/Infection). He was then intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure with an intialy ABG of 7.46/44/103/32. He was afebrile over his course. Since his admission to the outside hospital, he had been on  Gatifloxacin, Linezolid, Clindamycin, Zosyn, and Vancomycin. His final antibiotic regimen was Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for CAP/Aspiration PNA coverage. Bronchoscopy/BAL was not revealing. HIV, PPD, Legionalla Urine Ag, BCXR, UCXR, BAL/AFB, and a Viral Panel were negative. He was continued on Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers as needed. Of note, a TTE/ECHO showed a normal EF without clear signs of endocarditis. The patient had improved dramatically over his course and was comfortable on room air upon discharge. He was discharged with pulmonary follow-up. He was counseled in regards to smoking cessation.

2) Normocytic Anemia: He had a HCT in the high 20's to low 30's early in his course. The baseline was unknown. His iron studies, LDH/Bili/Hapto, B12/Folate were normal. His clinical picture was consistent with anemia of chronic disease and as his pulmonary inflammation/infection resolved, his HCT improved.
