INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. 

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic regurgitation. 

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion. 

Conclusions: 
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 
2. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. 
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. 
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
6/ Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
