Admission Date:  [**2016-08-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2016-09-09**]

Date of Birth:   [**1998-05-12**]       Sex:  F

Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 18-year-old female who was an unrestrained driver of a truck after where she lost control and rolled over.  She was ejected and ended up becoming entrapped underneath some of the wreckage.  The extrication time was approximately one hour.  There was a question of LOC.  Medflight arrived on the scene where her GCS was 15 and she was hemodynamically stable.  She was flown to [**Hospital1 189**] for trauma resuscitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the Trauma Bay, her heart rate was 88, blood pressure 90/palpable.  She was breathing at 20, 100% on room air.  She was in moderate distress.  She had multiple facial lacerations but her face was stable.  Her TMs were clear.  Her neck was in a C collar with the trachea midline.  The chest had equal breath sounds bilaterally and there was no instability of the chest wall.
Her heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft and nontender with a negative fast.  She had on the right upper extremity a large degloving injury to her forearm and an obvious deformity.  She had good neurovascular examination.  Her right lower extremity had a large thigh deformity laceration and large area of abrasion.  Her distal neurovascular examination on the lower extremities was intact.  The pelvis was stable.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, hematocrit 35, INR 1.3.  BUN and creatinine 16 and 0.9.  Amylase 29.  Tox screen was negative.  There was large blood in the urine, [**07-05**] RBCs.

The patient underwent multiple studies.  A CT of the head was negative for any bleed.

C-spine CT was negative for fracture or dislocation or canal impingement.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a right superior pubic rami fracture, right L4-5 transverse process fracture, a right sacral fracture extending to the sacroiliac joint with no diastasis.  The right upper extremity revealed no solid organ injury and no free air in the abdomen.

An x-ray of the right upper extremity demonstrated radial ulnar fracture of the forearm.  Right lower extremity demonstrated a displaced right femoral fracture, nondisplaced fracture of the proximal right fibula.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was stabilized in the trauma bay, remained hemodynamically stable and after uncovering the extensive orthopedic injuries, she was taken to the Operating Room by the Orthopedic's Team.  At this time, the patient was also noted to have a significant perineal injury and the
General Surgery and Colorectal Surgery teams were involved.
At that initial operating room intervention, the patient underwent multiple procedures which included incision and drainage of the right forearm, external fixation of the right forearm fractures, and IM rodding of the right femur.  A perineal debridement followed by rectal washout and a diverting end-colostomy.

The patient tolerated all of these procedure well, remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring, ventilatory support and continued workup for injuries.

The patient's ensuing hospital course was significant for multiple trips to the Operating Room for debridement of her right thigh and buttock region.  There were multiple swab cultures taken and the patient was placed on the appropriate antibiotics.  She tolerated all of these procedures well and to facilitate the multiple trips to the Operating Room, the patient required ventilatory support and remained intubated during this period of time.  For sedation, she remained on narcotic and benzodiazepine drips which maintained her appropriate sedation levels.

On [**2016-08-16**], while undergoing the debridement of the right buttock and thigh wound, underwent an ultrasound of the rectum which demonstrated an intact sphincter.  She also was noted at this time to have right purulent drainage from the right forearm where the external fixator had been placed and this was opened and debrided.  Approximately a week after the initial injury and multiple debridements, Plastic Surgery was involved and after careful consideration it was considered for a VAC drain placement to allow the bed of tissue to granulate and look towards wound closure at some future point.  This was placed and she was continued on appropriate antibiotics.

Her nutrition was addressed with TPN initially and she was converted to tube feeds which she has tolerated.  Infectious Disease consultation was obtained. Due to the extensive debridement of the right thigh and buttock region which was essentially down to the bone, the patient was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics which will be continued for an extensive period of time beyond this admission.

Beginning on [**2016-08-19**], the patient began to have temperature spikes and she was pan cultured.  She was maintained on her broad spectrum antibiotics.  On [**2016-08-24**], she was taken back to the Operating Room by the
Orthopedics Team where her right femur rod was removed and she had a replacement IM rod placed.  She had an echocardiogram which did not demonstrate any vegetations.

After that orthopedic procedure, the patient actually defervesced.  She was maintained on her antibiotic course.
The VAC drains have been periodically changed every three to five days.

In early August, the patient was weaned to extubation which she has tolerated.  She was weaned off of her sedation which had resulted actually in high levels of narcotic and benzodiazepines.  In order to combat withdrawal, she was placed on an around the clock dose of Ativan to combat any tremulousness or withdrawal symptoms.

On [**2016-08-30**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room with Plastic Surgery where she underwent a split-thickness skin graft taken from her left thigh donor site and placed on the right thigh and buttock area.  She tolerated this procedure well.  Post procedure, a VAC dressing was placed over the skin graft.

On [**2016-09-01**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room where she underwent an ORIF of the right forearm fracture.  She tolerated this procedure well.  The right forearm VAC was placed.  The remainder of her stay in the ICU has remained stable.  She defervesced without any temperature spikes.  All of her recent cultures have been negative to date.  She continues on her broad spectrum antibiotics per Infectious Disease and will remain so for an approximate length of 12 weeks.  There are plans for Plastic Surgery to return to remove the buttock VAC to examine the skin graft.

Upon completion of the examination of the skin graft, the patient will be ready for discharge to rehabilitation to continue her likely long rehabilitation course.  She has actually done quite well despite the numerous and severity of her injuries.

The patient's list of injuries at this point include the following:
1.  Right femur fracture, status post rodding times two.
2.  Right bone forearm fracture, status post open reduction and internal fixation.
3.  A right open pelvic fracture and a right superior rami fracture.
4.  A right proximal fibula fracture.
5.  Right L4-5 transverse process fracture (Neurosurgery had been consulted with regards to this injury.  They recommended a TLSO brace times one month).
6.  Right sacral fracture and right iliac bone fracture.
7.  Perineal injury requiring a diverting colostomy and perineal washout.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post motor vehicle crash with the injuries as above.
2.  Pseudomonas sputum culture, multiorganism.
3.  Osteomyelitis of the right pelvis and deep tissue infection.
4.  Extended ventilatory wean secondary to multiple operations.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vancomycin 2 grams IV q. 12 hours.
2.  Meropenem 2 grams IV q. eight.
3.  Clindamycin 600 mg IV q. eight.
4.  Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously q.d.
5.  Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers one to two puffs q. four hours p.r.n.
6.  Zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Ativan 1 mg IV q. six hours.
8.  Methadone 20 mg b.i.d.
9.  Nystatin swish and swallow q.i.d. p.r.n.
10. Miconazole powder applied as needed.
11. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. four to six hours p.r.n.
12. Bacitracin ointment, apply as needed.

DISPOSITION: The patient remains neurologically intact, is ready for rehabilitation.  She will require extensive physical therapy and occupational therapy.  She will continue to have wound monitoring and final recommendations will be placed with her discharge information per Plastics and Hand
Orthopedic Team.  She will require continued nutritional support and as she tolerates her diet, her tube feeds can be weaned and adjusted as necessary.  She will continue her antibiotic course and final recommendations will be left per her Infectious Disease consultation and a PICC line will be assessed and placed if necessary.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
