There is a small lateral and basal component of the pneumothorax on the right.  Left IJ line remains unchanged in position.  There is worsening of underlying subcutaneous emphysema since the prior day study.  The right-sided chest tube remains unchanged in position, crossing the midline and overlying the left upper lung zone.  Interval clearing of left retrocardiac opacity, likely representing atelectasis.  Persisting small bilateral effusions.  Background emphysematous changes.

IMPRESSION:

2) Chest tube remains crossing the midline to opposite hemithorax. 3) Increase in underlying subcutaneous emphysema. 4) Persisting bilateral pleural effusions with interval clearing of left retrocardiac atelectasis.
