INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild tricuspid [1+] regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 

PERICARDIUM: There is a small pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with one iv injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest. 

Conclusions: 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is massively dilated. There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. Echodense region seen in the main pulmonary artery and proximal left pulmonary artery suggestive of thrombus. 

Compared to the prior study of [**2015-02-10**], findings are similar (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now slightly lower). The proximal pulmonary artery was better visualized in the current study. 

The interatrial septum is bowed toward the left atrium. Contrast study revealed a shunt (passage of bubbles right to left) consistent with the presence of a stretched patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect.
