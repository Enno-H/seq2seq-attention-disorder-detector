INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. 

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. 

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. 

PERICARDIUM: Moderate to large pericardial effusion. RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator. Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer caring for the patient. 

Conclusions: 
The left atrium and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion (1.5-2.0 cm). There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade physiology. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular function
