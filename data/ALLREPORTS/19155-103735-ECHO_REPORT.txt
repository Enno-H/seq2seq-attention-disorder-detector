INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. 

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal inferior - hypo; mid inferior - hypo; basal inferolateral - hypo; mid inferolateral - hypo; remaining LV segments contract normally. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. 

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Cannot exclude AS. Mild (1+) AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild (1+) MR. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate. 

Conclusions: 
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Significant aortic stenosis cannot cannot be excluded, but severe stenosis is unlikely. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to cooperate. 

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. ?aortic stenosis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta. 

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on 1997 AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
