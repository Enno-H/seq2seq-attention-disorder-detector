R elbow [**08-11**]: There is a slightly angulated fracture through the right radial neck. There are no other fractures identified. 

R tib/fib [**08-11**]: Two views of the femur and three views of the right tibia and fibula were obtained. There are obliquely oriented displaced fractures through the distal right tibia and fibula with significant lateral and posterior displacement of the distal fracture fragments. There are several small associated bony fragments. A minimally displaced fracture is also noted through the proximal right fibula. The femur demonstrates no evidence of fracture.

CT Head: neg
CT Cspine: neg

CT Abd: TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of 150 cc of Optiray contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were also obtained.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST. The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits. The airways are patent to the segmental level bilaterally. There are patchy bilateral areas of parenchymal opacity best appreciated in the posterior aspects of the upper lobes as well as the lower lobes bilaterally consistent with contusions. Linear densities are also appreciated in the lower lobes bilaterally which could be consistent with atelectatic change. There is no pneumothorax or effusion. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST. There is a linear defect through the right inferior and posterior aspect of the liver consistent with a laceration. A tiny punctate focus of hyperdensity is appreciated along the medial aspect of this laceration within the liver parenchyma which is felt to be most consistent with a small vessel rather than active extravasation. The remainder of the liver, gallbladder, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are within normal limits. There is a moderate amount of high density material in the right retroperitoneal region expanding the perirenal space with associated perirenal stranding. The kidneys are otherwise within normal limits with symmetric nephrograms. The adrenals are unremarkable. There is no free air. CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST. A Foley is present within the nondistended bladder. The distal ureters, rectum, uterus and adnexa are within normal limits. There is no pathologic adenopathy. BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. No fractures are identified. CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: The above findings were confirmed with coronal and sagittal reformations.
IMPRESSION:
1. Liver laceration of the right posterior liver. 
2. Right-sided perirenal/retroperitoneal hematoma with preserved renal function. 3. Pulmonary contusions.

CXR: [**08-15**]: Patchy opacities in bilateral lower lobes, probably representing combination of contusion and atelectasis in this patient status post motor vehicle accident.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Trauma [**Hospital Unit Name 47**] on [**08-11**] with the injuries listed above. She remained hemodynamically stable on presentation and throughout her stay. On HD#2 she went to the OR with orthopedics for ORIF right tib/fib, closed reduction right radial head.  On HD#3 she was transferred to the floor. Her pain was initially controlled with a Dilaudid PCA. SHe was still having persistent pain all over and acute pain service was consulted. She was switched to oral oxycodone and percocet, with adequate pain control during the rest of her stay. On HD#4 her Hct had trended down to 20 and she was transfused 2 units PRBC with appropriate increase of her Hct. Her Hct remained stable during the rest of her stay.  Repeat CT of her abdomen showed improved perirenal hematoma, improved liver laceration.
She was seen by PT & OT and her activity advanced. 
She was also seen by social work and psychiatry for occasionally voiced suicidal thoughts. She was cleared by psychiatry, although it was thought that she would benefit from continued evaluation by psychiatry at her rehab center and eventual outpatient psychiatry follow-up. she was seen by dr [**Last Name (STitle) 259**] and he felt she was developing an eschar on her rt medial leg she was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 258**] and started on abx  her wound over the next three days remain unchanged and she was accepted to [**Hospital1 **]  she was starting to put more effort in to her ot of her rt elbow  and was ready for transfer to rehab
