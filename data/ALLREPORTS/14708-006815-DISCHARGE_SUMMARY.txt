Micro: URINE CULTURE (Final [**2018-06-20**]):    NO GROWTH. 

Rads:

[**2018-06-18**] Non-contrast head CT:
FINDINGS: No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified. There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles are normal in size and symmetric, and the basal cisterns are well visualized. The density of the brain parenchyma appears unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate marked mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus, unchanged. The mastoid air cells are clear. The orbits appear unremarkable. The surrounding soft tissue structures do not demonstrate any abnormalities. IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic mucosal changes in the left maxillary sinus.

[**2018-06-18**] CXR:
FINDINGS: There is an ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe partially obscuring the right diaphragm that likely represents small amount of atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. The left costophrenic angle was not imaged and thus a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in projection. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe atelectasis

[**2018-06-18**] ECG: Baseline artifact 
Sinus tachycardia. Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes are suggested but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult. Since previous tracing of [**2018-06-02**], sinus tachycardia and slight 
ST-T wave changes present 

[**2018-06-19**] CXR: Lung volumes are low with several bibasilar areas of atelectasis. The heart size is normal. The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: Bilateral bibasilar atelectasis with no overt evidence of pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Altered mental status, Narcotic overdose: Tox screen negative for everything except opiates. Patient was initially poorly responsive, but came around with Narcan. Admited to ICU for close monitoring. After first 12hours in the hospital, he became more interactive and stated that while out on his day pass from the [**Hospital1 6419**] House he took what he thought were Tylenol that a friend gave him. He also stated that on occassion he takes  Percocet for R knee pain, unclear if this is prescribed for him and if so which MD prescribes it. He denied taking it on the day of his admit. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 3**], his mental status remained stable after his first 24 hours. Though he denied SI on admit, he does have a strong h/o SI and later during course noted that he was hearing voices telling him to hurt himself. He had insight that this was from his pscyh illness.

2) Aspiration pneumonitis: Patient received levofloxacin and flagyl in the [**Doctor First Name 2**] for presumed asp pneumonia, though abx were stopped once he arrived in the [**Hospital Unit Name 3**] as it was felt that he was stable and likely had a chemical pneumonitis from aspiration rather than pna. His WBC trended down, he remained afebrile, and his respiratory status improved.

3) Substance abuse: substance abuse counsellor consulted. 
Avoided narcotics or sedating meds while in house.

4) Schizoaffective disorder: restarted psychiatric medications once he was awake enough to eat, except for Neurontin, Benadryl and Remeron at the advice of the [**Hospital Unit Name **] team in house. As noted above, he continued to have AH regarding hurting himself and per [**Hospital Unit Name **] was kept on a 1:1 sitter, despite his statements that he was not going to hurt himself. Will need further management of his condition in a monitored locked unit after discharge from medical care.

5) Elevated blood glucose: his daily fasting AM blood glucose values ranged 110-120, with no values over 126. Started [**Doctor First Name **] diet. Should have outpt GTT to eval for impaired glucose tolerance. Will benefit from weight loss regimen.

6) Prophylaxis: heparin SC, PPI . Folate, Thiamine, MVI.
