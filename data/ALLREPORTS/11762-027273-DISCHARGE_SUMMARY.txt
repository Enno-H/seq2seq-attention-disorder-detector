Chief Complaint:
Syncope

None

History of Present Illness:
63 yo female with history of schizoaffective disorder with SI, UC s/p sigmoidectomy, COPD who was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 4225**] for pneumonia and suicidal ideation. Patient presented on 
[**2014-06-02**] s/p fall at her group home and found to be hypotensive secondary to dehydration and atenolol intake.

Of note, she has had multiple admissions in the past for lightheadness and was admitted to [**Hospital1 2926**] for the same complaint from [**Date range (1) 4226**]. At that time the patient fell in the bathroom and hit the back of her head on her bath tub. She recalls having a head CT which was negative. Up to and throughout that hospitalization she had nausea and vomiting which only resolved on her day prior to discharge. After discharge she was feeling well and tolerating PO's. She had occassional feelings of diziness, but thought it was due to the psychosocial stress over the murder of her grandson's girlfriend. 

She continued to eat and drink well with no diarrhea, melena, hematochezia. She denied headache but has been taking Motrin 600mg qid for left hip pain. She decided to take her Atenolol which she had taken in the past but was no longer taking on the morning of admission. The diziness progressed and she felt presyncopal and fell onto her backside with her left foot underneath her. She had no fecal or urinary incontinence. In [**Doctor First Name 45**], her SBP was in the 70's and she was given 1 liter fluid with good response. It was initially thought to be due to atenolol ovedose and she was given glucagon and calcium gluconate with no further improvement. Pt complained of foot pain and had negative plain x-ray of her foot, but after she was given 1mg of morphine her SBP's decreased to to 60's which didn't respond to Narcan so decision was made for ICU admission. Patient responded well to IVF in the ICU and thought that her symptoms were a combination of Atenolol overdose along with dehydration from decrease po intake.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo female with multiple medical problems who presented s/p fall and found to be hypotensive secondary to dehydration and ingestion of atenolol that seemed to have resolved with IVF.

1. Hypotension:
- likely secondary to dehydration as responded well to IVF and did have some acute renal failure that resolved with fluids - could have been superimposed with atenolol overdose although patient denies taking multiple pills. BP and HR have returned to [**Location 476**] by HD#2. Will continue to hold Atenolol until reevaluation of BP as an outpatient. Suggest restarting at a lower dose and titrating up gradually. - has had multiple workups in the past including a pMIBI in 8/03 which was unremarkable. Echo done [**2014-06-03**] showed EF 55-60% with mild to moderate AR and mild MR; no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities - was ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes - medications adjusted as per [**Hospital Unit Name 120**] team; avoid narcotics

2. Heme:
- HCT drop likely secondary to volume resuscitation - iron studies consistent with deficiency of chronic disease likely from her ulcerative colitis with inappropriately low Retic Index. Guaiac neg on exam. Instructed to f/u with PCP for further monitoring.

3. COPD: 
- not wheezy at this time and so will continue on outpatient Combivent and Advair MDI's.  - smoking cessation; is on Wellbutrin which will facilitate this; cont nicotine patch to prevent withdrawal

4. Foot pain:
- findings not suggestive of severe trauma and plain films show no fracture - continue to treat with Ibuprofen around the clock, and Tylenol prn, and be gentle with narcotics for risk of hypotension -PT evaluation. Is safe to go to home with cane. Will arrange VNA home PT to work on strength and use of cane.

5. Schizoaffective D/O:
- denies SI at this time and denies taking overdose of atenolol - seen by the Psychiatry team who recommended to d/c buspirone, reduce trazodone, and reduce risperidone and move it to QHS
Did not need sitter at any point. No SI/AH. 

6. Ulcerative colitis:
- denies diarrhea as precipitant for dehydration and labs show no low bicarb
- cont on her output mesalamine dose. Is guaiac Neg.
