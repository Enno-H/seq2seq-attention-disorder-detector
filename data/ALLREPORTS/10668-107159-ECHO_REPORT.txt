INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). Severe resting LVOT gradient. Findings consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. 

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS. Mild (1+) AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

Conclusions: 
1. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). 2. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. 
3. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 5. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
