GENERAL:  In no acute distress, alert and oriented x 3.
HEAD AND NECK:  Anicteric.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Obese.  Soft abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, nondistended.  She does have some tenderness in the right side of the abdomen, and some tenderness associated with her prior appendectomy scar. RECTAL EXAM:  Guaiac negative with no masses and no stool in the rectal vault.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 7.8, hematocrit 34.1, platelets 234.  Coags within normal limits.  CK-MB and cardiac enzymes were negative.  She had a sodium of 149, potassium 3.1, chloride 119, bicarb 22, BUN 15, creatinine
0.3, lactate 1.4.
CHEST X-RAY:  Showed a right-sided pleural effusion with a large hiatal hernia with no obvious free air. ABDOMINAL X-RAY:  Although it did not show any dilated loops, it did show significant paucity of air distally. CAT SCAN ABDOMEN:  Showed a diagnosis of a small bowel obstruction, dilated loops of small bowel, the proximal jejunum in the left upper quadrant with an associated transition point.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Because of the findings of a small bowel obstruction, Ms. [**lastname 3205**] was admitted to the general surgery purple service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 704**].  She was made NPO, given IV fluids, and had an NG tube, and Foley catheter placed.  The rest of her hospital course can be discussed in an organ system based fashion.  The major problems were cardiovascular, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal.

1) CARDIOVASCULAR:  On hospital day #2, Ms. [**lastname 3205**] had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.  Intravenous Lopressor was not able to convert her, and neither was diltiazem.
However, the AFIB did respond to amiodarone.  She was placed on an amiodarone drip which she tolerated well, and cardiology was consulted, and they followed her for the rest of her admission.  Gradually, the amiodarone was converted over to PO, and she was sent home on PO amiodarone. Follow-up pulmonary function tests were scheduled as an outpatient as a baseline to check for pulmonary sequelae to chronic amiodarone dosing.

On hospital day #4, Ms. [**lastname 3205**] was transferred to the ICU for decreased respiratory status.  A STAT echocardiogram was obtained which revealed 2+ aortic insufficiency.  Because of this new onset of atrial fibrillation, she was anticoagulated with Coumadin.  This was started on [**03-27**], prior to her discharge.

2) RESPIRATORY:  As mentioned above, Ms. [**lastname 3205**] had an episode of poor sats and just general respiratory instability.  She was transferred to the ICU for closer care. At this time, a right IJ central line was attempted, but the patient could not tolerate it, and a left subclavian line was attempted.  However, as a complication to this line, the patient developed a left pneumothorax.  A pigtail catheter was placed with good result, and the pneumothorax was relieved.  That occurred on [**03-24**].  On [**03-26**], the chest tube was placed to water-seal and was subsequently discontinued without any difficulties.

3) GI:  Ms. [**lastname 3205**] presented with a small bowel obstruction with a transition point.  This was managed conservatively with NG tube decompression and intravenous fluids.  She eventually opened up, and on hospital day #3 she passed flatus.  During all the excitement with her being transferred to the unit and having the pneumothorax, PO food was not started until [**03-26**].  This was started with sips and was slowly advanced to a low-residual diet without nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.  Therefore, on [**2013-03-28**], hospital day #9, Ms. [**lastname 3205**] was discharged to home in good condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Small bowel obstruction.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3. Rapid atrial fibrillation.
4. Aortic insufficiency.
5. Pleural effusion.
6. Pneumothorax.
7. Gastroesophageal reflux.
8. Hiatal hernia.
9. Iron deficiency anemia.
10.Colonic polyps.

FOLLOW-UP:
1. She will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 658**], her primary cardiologist, who has agreed to follow her Coumadin levels. She is going to get her INR checked on Tuesday, [**04-02**], at Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 6299**] after receiving 5 days of low dose Coumadin, and on the 18 she has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 658**]. 2.
