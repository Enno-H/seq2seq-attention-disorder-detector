INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Depressed LVEF. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS. Right parasternal view used for AS gradient. Mild (1+) AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) MR. Eccentric MR jet. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Compared to the findings of the prior study, the severity of aortic stenosis has increased. 

Conclusions: 
1. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears depressed. Distal septal and apical hypokinesis is probably present. 
2. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. 
4. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
5. Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2011-05-04**], the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.
