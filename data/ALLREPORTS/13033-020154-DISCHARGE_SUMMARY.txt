HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 34-year-old male with history of type 1 diabetes complicated by autonomic neuropathy ,
gastroparesis, and chronic renal insufficiency with coronary artery disease and malignant hypertension that has led to multiple admissions to [**Hospital 126**] fo

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  Patient presented with prior poor control of his hypertension.  He was restarted on all of his regular antihypertensive medications including Lopressor, nifedipine, lisinopril, and clonidine, and for poor control of his blood pressure, hydralazine and labetalol prn were added.

As further history was gathered during his hospital stay indicated that the patient's symptoms may have been preceded by micturition.  The possibility of an intracystic pheochromocytoma was considered despite the fact that the patient has had negative urine metanephrines in the past.  To evaluate this possibility further, a MIBG scan was scheduled for the following week.  In preparation for this MIBG scan, the patient was weaned off his alpha and calcium-channel blockers as this was necessary for an accurate [**Location (un) 655**].

During this time, his blood pressure remained quite labile.
The first labetalol and hydralazine were used for control, but after further episodes of poorly controlled hypertension, nitroglycerin IV drip was used as needed.  Patient was transferred to the West Campus in preparation for this MIBG scan.  As his blood pressure continued to be quite labile, it was clear that closer monitoring and better control of his blood pressure was indicated, therefore the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] on [**12-01**], where a Nipride drip was started.  Patient was weaned off all of his calcium-channel blockers, alpha blockers, and beta blockers in preparation for the MIBG scan, which occurred on [**12-02**] and [**12-04**].

Patient was transferred back to Medicine floor on [**12-04**] and on [**12-05**], his blood pressure was well controlled on his regular oral antihypertensive regimen.  The results of the MIBG scan were pending at the time of discharge.

2. Endocrine:  Patient has a history of type 1 diabetes.  He was continued on his regular glargine dose with regular insulin-sliding scale to cover for elevated blood sugars, fingersticks continued q.i.d.

3. Gastroparesis:  When the patient was taking p.o. diet, he was continued on his regular regimen per treatment of his gastroparesis including erythromycin, Reglan, and famotidine, antiemetics including Zofran were also used to control intermittent nausea.

4. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient was advanced slowly to his regular diet on admission after having a history of nausea and vomiting.  As his symptoms were thought to sometimes follow eating he was made NPO to evaluate this possible connection.  During this time the patient received
PPN and then TPN and then nutrition consultation on [**11-27**].  He resumed his regular diabetic diet.  IV fluids were often administered during his hospital stay to address increase in creatinine.

5. Renal:  Patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.7 to 1.9.
During his hospital stay, his creatinine rose up to 2.6.  IV fluids were administered to address this renal failure. Prerenal etiology was initially suspected but was not supported by FENa calculation as creatinine elevation was thought to be due to hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy. At the time of discharge, his creatinine had trended towards baseline.

6. Intravenous access:  Patient had a Port-A-Cath and a right IJ line placed during his hospital stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable, afebrile with blood pressure well controlled on p.o. medications.  Patient is asymptomatic.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is being discharged to home.  He will be visiting his father, who is hospitalized at a local hospital.
