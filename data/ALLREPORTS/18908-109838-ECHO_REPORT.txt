INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

Study done on the day following pericardiocentesis. 
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2016-11-01**]. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and/or RV. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery. 

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: BIleaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). 

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. 

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No RA diastolic collapse. No RV diastolic collapse. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Compared with the findings of the prior study, the size of the pericardial effusion has decreased. 

Conclusions: 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial diastolic or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2016-11-01**], the size of the pericardial effusion has decreased. 

Impression: 
A small circumferential pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
