History of Present Illness:
72 y/o male with PMHx of NSCLC, PE, who presented to the [**Doctor First Name **] on [**03-14**] with generally increasing fatigue and tachypnea.  

In the [**Doctor First Name **], He underwent CTA chest and abdomen which no PE but marked progression of metastatic disease including innumerable new metastases in the lungs and liver and increased size of metastases in the adrenals, kidneys, mesentary, soft tissues. He had negative CT head and EKG. His hematocrit was 26 from baseline around 30, and INR was 3.6 on admission. He received FFP, 1 unit PRBC, and a dose of cefepime vanc. Due to slightly low blood pressure, the patient was also given steroids and 1L NS and admitted to the FICU.  

In the ICU, his HCT improved and BP remained stable in the 100's, and HR in the 90-100's. EGD or further GI workup was refused. Oncology came to meet with the patient and his family, and decided that focusing goals of care on comfort was most appropriate. He was made DNR/DNI but medications were continued, and he was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 595**].  

ROS: He denies chest pain, shortness of breath. He does feel somewhat fatigued. He reports some right flank/back pain, [**08-29**] before receiving IV dialudid. He denies other concerns.  

Onc History: Initially found to have a large right sided mass on CXR in 10/06 performed for 1 month history of cough. CT scan confirmed the mass and biopsy of [**Last Name (un) 2439**] nodes were suspicious, but FNA of the primary mass showed likely NSCLC. PET showed abnormality on the right thyroid. He started radiation therapy in 11/06 and started cycle 1 of cisplatin/etoposide in 12/06 and cycle 2 in 1/07. He completed XRT [**2015-12-28**]. He was hospitalized for chest pain and found to have a PE in 1/07, and started on coumadin. PET scan in 2/06 demonstrated metastatic disease to the adrenals, so he was changed to taxotere therapy in 3/07 which he tolerated reasonably well.
