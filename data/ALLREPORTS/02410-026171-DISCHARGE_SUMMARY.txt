Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**lastname **] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1505**] [**Hospital **] Medical Center on [**2014-07-13**] for preoperative anticoagulation and surgical management of his aortic valve disease. Heparin was started and he was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2014-07-15**],  Mr. [**lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy with an aortic valve replacement utilizing a 23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) **] mechanical valve. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7875**] neurologically intact and was extubated. He was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for his mechanical valve and atrial fibrillation. Mr. [**lastname **] had pain with swallowing and his medications were changed to elixirs. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. The otolaryngology service was consulted who noted a mucosal irregularity on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Saline gargles were recommended and bactroban nasal ointment for epistaxis prophylaxis. Follow-up was recommended in 3 weeks to assess resolution of the lesion. Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] sore throat slowly improved so that he was able to adequately take in sufficient nutrition. As his INR was subtherapeutic, heparin was started until his INR was within range. Ultimately, his INR rose above 2.0 and his heparin was discontinued. Mr. [**lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day ten. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 457**], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
