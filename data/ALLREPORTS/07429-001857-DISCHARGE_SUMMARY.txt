Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Patient has been consistently febrile, initially started on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed pneumonia, sputum cultures and 

blood cultures positive for yeast. She was treated with meropenam, vancomycin, flagyl, and then on [**12-01**] caspofungin added. She continues to be febrile. Since [**11-30**] blood cultures have been negative, sputum continues to grow yeast. 

GI: On [**11-29**] she was noted to have rise in her LFT's and abdominal 
tenderness, she was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy  and found to have an ischemic colonic perforation. R colectomy and ileostomy placement was performed at that time. She is still 

not receiving feeds through the G tube. 

Heme: Initially anemic, now hct has been stable in mid-20's. 

Neuro: Pt when admitted on [**11-23**] was noted to follow commands and 

express pain. She was on her home regimen of paxil for anxiety. On day of admission she was started on propofol for agitation, it 
caused hypotension and it was weaned. She was at that time noted 

to be sedated but still following commands. On [**11-24**] she was switched to a versed drip. On [**11-26**] she was unarousable, versed stopped and only given morphine PRN. She was noted on [**11-27**] to follow commands and "awake and alert." [**11-29**] went to the OR, and afterwards was treated with propofol and fentanyl. On [**11-30**] she was noted to have minial movement of her LUE and none of her RUE, 
but moved both lower extremities in response to pain. On [**12-02**] she  was reported to be "following commands" and responding to painful  stimuli. She has been on a fentanyl drip until [**12-06**], when she was  switched to a fentanyl patch. On [**12-08**] fentanyl patch was d/c'ed and she has only been receiving fentanyl prn dressing changes. Today, it was noted that despite being off sedation for several days, she has not been awake or following commands initially However this status has continues to improve and patient had remained afebrile on trach trial up to 5 hours, she will need continued wound care to incision with wet to dry dressing
