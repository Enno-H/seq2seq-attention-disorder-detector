Her ascending aorta was 3.9 cm.

Sh[**Last Name (STitle) 8822**]admitted on [**2012-05-14**] and underwent redo sternotomy and aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm CE Magna ThermaFix pericardial valve and a 22 mm Gelweave thoracic outlet ascending aorta graft by Dr. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 162**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8823**]-[**Doctor Last Name 5000**] of [**Hospital 422**]. She was transferred to the cardiothoracic ICU in a stable condition in sinus rhythm on an epinephrine drip at 0.02 mcg/kg/min, a Levophed drip of 0.03 mcg/kg/min, and a propofol drip of 50 mcg/kg/min. Of note, the patient did have 2 separate cardiopulmonary bypass runs. Please refer to the operative dictated report.

On postoperative day 1, the patient was weaning slowly, was agitated on CPAP, with a cardiac index of 3.34, a stable blood pressure of 93/62, and T-max of 100.6. She was in sinus rhythm at 86 with a postoperative white count of 8.4, hematocrit 27.9, and creatinine of 0.7. She was in no apparent distress and was alert. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm, and her chest was stable. Her lungs were clear bilaterally. She had 2+ peripheral edema in her extremities. She was on a nitroglycerin drip at 1.0 and an epinephrine drip at 0.02, as well as an insulin drip at 3 units/h, and was started on her low-dose aspirin. She also began Lasix diuresis.

She was seen postoperatively also by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8824**], her surgeon from [**Hospital1 **], as well as the cardiology fellow from [**Hospital 422**]. She was also seen and evaluated by case management.

On postoperative day 2, she was off her epinephrine drip and began gentle beta blockade with Lopressor 12.5 p.o. b.i.d.
She was in sinus rhythm with a pressure of 92/46. She also had decreased breath sounds at her bases. Chest tubes remained in place, and the patient had been extubated the day prior.

On postoperative day 2, the patient was also transferred out to the floor and was encouraged to increase her pulmonary toilet with incentive spirometry, was started on a low dosed statin, and was given Toradol IV q. 6 for several doses and then switched over to Ultram. Mediastinal chest tubes and pacing wires were removed. Lasix was switched over to p.o. dosing 20 mg b.i.d. The patient was encouraged to increase her activity level. She remained in sinus rhythm with a stable creatinine of 0.6, and a stable hematocrit at 26.2.

Her mediastinal chest tube and her pacing wires had been removed that morning also. Her beta blockade was discontinued. Pleural tubes remained in place. Her Foley was on gravity drainage with a plan to discontinue the Foley later in the afternoon.

On postoperative day 5, the patient had no events overnight, remained off her beta blockade. A chest x-ray was ordered.
She was encouraged to continue ambulating, and discharge planning was begun. She had a moderate amount of drainage from her left pleural chest tube site. Her central venous line had already been removed, and pacing wires had already also been removed. She was alert and oriented and nonfocal. Her heart was regular rate and rhythm, and sternal incision was clean, dry and intact. She remained afebrile.
