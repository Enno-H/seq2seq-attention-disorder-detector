RADIOLOGY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2015-05-12**] 1:24 PM
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid arteries. Moderate plaque was identified on the right. On the right, peak systolic velocities are 136, 62, 75 in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 2.1. This is consistent with a 40-59% stenosis. On the left, peak systolic velocities are 95, 57, 66 in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.6. This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.
There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: On the right, there is moderate plaque with a 40-59% carotid stenosis. On the left, there is a less than 40% stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the day of surgery.  Due to his significant cardiac history a pulmonary artery catheter was placed in the OR for hemodynamic monitoring post-operatively.  He was extubated easily and transferred to the recovery room.  He was monitored in the intensive care unit post-operatively for fluid management and cardiology was involved for recommendations.  He was maintained on antibiotics throughout his hospital stay, however the culture from the operating room failed to reveal a pathogen.  He tolerated a regular diet POD1.  The PA catheter was removed on POD3.  He was transferred to the floor on POD4.  A carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained to evaluate a soft left carotid bruit heard during his hospital stay.  (see results section).  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 265**] of vascular surgery was consulted and will follow-up with the patient as an outpatient for further monitoring. 

The patient had [**Location (un) 1320**]-[**Location (un) 1321**] drains placed during the surgery and these remained in for his hospitalization.  The output of each was less than 30cc of serosanguinous fluid at discharge.  He was instructed as to care and emptying of the drains and will record outputs regularly.  He will also have visiting nursing care to aid in his wound and drain care.  He was discharged to home on Augmentin for another week and will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic.
