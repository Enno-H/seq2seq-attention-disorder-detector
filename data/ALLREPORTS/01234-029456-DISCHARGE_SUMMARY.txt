ECG: 100bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no st-tw changes. 

CXR: 1.  Suboptimal positioning of central venous catheter within the mid-right 
atrium.  This should be withdrawn by 5 cm. 
2.  Increasing parenchymal opacities at the left lung base.  This likely  represents asymmetric edema.  Alternatively, this could be a manifestation of  aspiration. 

KUB: Diffusely  dilated  loops  of  small  bowel  with  air-filled  colonic
loops. These  findings  could  represent  ileus  or  early  small  bowel  obstruction.

ABG:7.34/47/133 on NRB 

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo m w/ h/o recent cva and g-tube placement who p/w new onset hypoxia, w/ rhonchi on exam, LLL opacity on cxr, elevated lactate on MUST protocol.

1) MUST- Lactate remains elevated despite high svo2.  BPs stable so no indication for pressors/inotropes.  Pt rec'd 4L NS in [**Doctor First Name **] so adequately volume resuscitated by criteria.  Cortisol stim test pending.  Does not meet criteria for APC given recent CVA and low [**Doctor First Name 2672**] score (11).  Likely etiology is infectious given significant bandemia, most probable is pulmonary given LLL findings and lung exam.  PNA vs aspiration. Other possibilities included enteric given findings on KUB and recent surgical placement of PEG tube.  Covered w/ vanc/ceftriaxone/azithro, no indication for additional pseudomonal coverage w/ cefepime. Used NS boluses to maintain cvp>8 and patient was continued on MUST protocol.  Hospital course as below.

2) PNA-presumptively treating for, pt rec'd 
vanc/azithro/ceftrixone/cefepime/clindamycin in [**Doctor First Name **].  Simplified regimen to include vanc/ceftriaxone/azithro. Sputum culture grew out e.coli and klebsiella.  Over the hospital course the patient's respiratory status deteriorated.  In d/w family, patient's goals of care were changed to CMO given his ongoing decompensation.  Patient passed away on HD2 of respiratory failure. 

3) illeus- also possible that pt may have transmigrated bacteria secondary to illeus.  covered for gram neg on admission.  

4) glucose- RISS, QID fs

5) prophylaxis- maintained on gi, hep sc, pneumoboots (aggressive given h/o DVT)
