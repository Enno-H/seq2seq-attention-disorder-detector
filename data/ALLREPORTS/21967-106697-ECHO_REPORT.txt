INTERPRETATION: 

Findings: 

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular cavity is dilated. 

AORTA: The aortic root is mildly dilated. 

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild tricuspid [1+] regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve is not well seen. 

PERICARDIUM: There is a small pericardial effusion. 

Conclusions: 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular free wall motion appears grossly preserved. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study of [**2014-09-21**], there is probably no significant change. 

Report modified on [**2014-09-23**] to note that a right heart catheter/wire was observed without any definite associated mass.
